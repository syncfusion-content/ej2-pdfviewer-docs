{% tabs %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/pdfviewer/addformfield-cs4/index.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}

{% include code-snippet/pdfviewer/addformfield-cs4/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
          
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/pdfviewer/addformfield-cs4" %}

## Edit/Update form field programmatically

We should get the Form Field object/Id from FormFieldCollections property that you would like to edit and pass it as a parameter to updateFormField method.

{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
